# Nord theme for nvUltra Beta

As of the writing of this `README`, there is only one main file. I plan to make several different options with all the different pallets, but for right now there is just one theme that uses the combinations of all the available pallets (at the time of writing). The theme currently looks like this:

If you like the Nord theme or nvUltra, feel free to file a fork request, or an issue if you have any! This is just a side project right now, so development will be slow. Thanks for being patient!




## How to install

Clone or download this repository. Unzip the package and copy the `nord.theme` file.

Now go the preferences pane in nvUltra by pressing `âŒ˜+,` on macOS, or `^+,` on Windows.

Go to the *Appearance* tab, and click *Open Themes Folder* at the top right.

Once this folder is open, copy the `nord.theme` file into it. At this point, you should be able to safely delete your downloaded repository. Restart nvUltra, go to `View -> Theme`, and select `nord` in the options. You may also want to select it as your default theme in the *Appearance* area of settings.
